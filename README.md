# Rebooting the Web-of-Trust

This repository contains documents related to the "Rebooting the Web-of-Trust" series of events in the fall of 2015 and early 2016.

## DesignShop November 3rd & 4th, 2015

The first DesignShop event, to be held in the Bay Area on November 3rd & 4th 2015, is a facilitated, invite-only event focused on creating the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. The goal of this initial DesignShop is to generate 5 technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that will have the greatest impact on the future.

### Gitter

### Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the November DesignShop, all participants were requested to post in the [Topics and Advanced Readings](topics-and-advance-readings) folder a 1 or 2 page topics paper to be shared with other attendees on either:
* A specific problem that you'd like to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (pgp or ca-based pki) can't address the problem?
*  A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

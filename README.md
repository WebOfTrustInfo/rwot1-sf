# Rebooting the Web-of-Trust

This repository contains documents related to the "Rebooting the Web-of-Trust" series of events in the fall of 2015 and early 2106.

## DesignShop November 2nd & 3rd 2015

The first DesignShop event, to be held in the Bay Area on November 2nd & 3rd, is a facilitated, invite-only even focused on creating the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. The goal of this initial event is to generate 5 technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that will have the greatest impact on the future.

In advance of the DesignShop, all participants are requested to post in the [Topics and Advanced Readings](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/tree/master/topics-and-advance-readings) folder a 1 to 2-page topics paper to be shared with other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that you'd like to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (pgp or ca-based pki) can't address the problem?
*  A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

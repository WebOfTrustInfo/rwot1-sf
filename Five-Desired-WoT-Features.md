# Five Desirable Features for the Next Generation Web of Trust

by David Strayhorn

**STATUS: UNFINISHED FIRST DRAFT**

## Abstract

I provide a brief description of five desirable features for a web of trust-based ratings and reputation system of the future.

## Introduction 

Ratings and reputation systems of contemporary social networks like eBay, Reddit, Amazon, Yelp, etc leave much to be desired. In this article I present five highly desired features that are lacking in the current state of the art but which must be envisioned in the next generation WoT. For the sake of illustration, I will discuss how each feature might be implemented in the specific case of a Reddit-style bulletin board to address one of the most vexing problems of many social networks: ***trolls***.

Organizing principle: The end-user will be the ultimate steward of his or her own data.

## Features

#### 1. Flexibility / Customizability: *The end-user must have exquisite control over the details of design elements of the ratings and reputation system.*

Reputation systems of today are defined centrally, are inflexible, and are frequently opaque. Needs will vary over time, from community to community, from user to user, and even within the same user but different contexts. In the WoT of the future, the end-user will have the ability to create new ways to rate products/users/content – new ’labels’ – as well as new ways to analyze the data.

***Bulletin board example:*** Suppose a user comes up with the idea of two new cagories of users: Trolls, who do what trolls do, and Troll Spotters, whose job is to flag users who exhibit troll-like behaviour. The purpose of this categorization is to ignore content generated by anyone in the Troll category. But instead of flagging each and every Troll by hand, each user maintains a conceivably relatively small and simple list of trusted Troll Spotters and stipulates that anyone flagged as a Troll by a Troll Spotter will be treated as a Troll by you. Flags generated by anyone else are ignored. If you wish, you can make a more complicated algorithm (e.g. that at least two Troll Spotters must flag a user before that user is treated as a Troll).  These categorizations (Troll, Troll Spotter, and the associated algorithm) are broadcast publicly with the goal that other users start using them. They either gain widespread usage or they don’t. If not, no harm done.

#### 2. Simplicity of User Interface: *The WoT needs to be simple for the casual or beginner end user to use, despite the complexities introduced by the various other desired features (primarily flexibility).*

One may think it will be impossible to make a WoT both simple and flexible, because flexibility will introduce too many complications. The solution to this problem is summed up in two words: *default settings*.

#### 3. Privacy: *The end user must have exquisite control over privacy settings.*

#### 4. Monetizability: *The end user will be the one to monetize his or her data, and will have a myriad of strategies to do so.*

#### 5. Portability: *Identity and reputation must be readily portable between one social network and the next.*
